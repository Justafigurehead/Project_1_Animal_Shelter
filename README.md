# Project_1_Animal_Shelter
Project 1, Animal Shelter 

Technology: Ruby, Post-gres SQL, Sinatra
My project brief was to create a website for an animal shelter so it could track their animalsâ€™ recovery
and adoption as well as a list of possible owners. The project requirements were to use only Ruby, SQL
and Sinatra.
